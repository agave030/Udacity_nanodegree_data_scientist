    "For this project, you will pick a dataset. Inspired by Robert, there are a few public datasets from AirBnB available below, but you may also choose a dataset similar to what was used in the lessons, or an entirely different dataset. Using your dataset, you will choose 3 questions you aspire to answer from the data.\n",

    "1. Pick a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.\n",

    "        - Gather necessary data to answer your questions\n",
    "        - Handle categorical and missing data\n",
    "        - Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them\n",
    "    - Analyze, Model, and Visualize\n",
    "        - Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.\n",
    "4. Communicate your business insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind. \n",
    "- Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience. \n",
